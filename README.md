Methode : Quicksort et Mergesort

This project can be completed to 80%.
To achieve this, you must to succeed in sorting :
	3 numbers <= 3 command
	5 numbers <= 12 command

But if you want more :
	100 numbers 
*	: operations <= 700 command = 5 points
*	: operations <= 900 command = 4 points
*	: operations <= 1100 command = 3 points
*	: operations <= 1300 command = 2 points
*	: operations <= 1500 command = 1 point

with :
	500 numbers 
*	: operations <= 5500 = 5 points
*	: operations <= 7000 = 4 points
*	: operations <= 8500 = 3 points
*	: operations <= 10000 = 2 points
*	: operations <= 11500 = 1 point
